# Linko

This is a toy URL shortener project, to be used as the starter repo for the Logging and Telemetry course on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/).

It's intentionally small, a little messy, and realistic enough to practice adding logs, metrics, and traces in Go.

To build project with build tags, project need to be builded with next command:

```shell
go build  -ldflags "-X boot.dev/linko/internal/build.GitSHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD) -X boot.dev/linko/internal/build.BuildTime=$(date -u '+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')" -o linko
```
